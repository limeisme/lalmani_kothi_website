        <h2>History & Significance</h2>
        <p>
          Kashi, also known as Varanasi or Banaras, is one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited cities. Revered as the spiritual capital of India, it sits on the banks of the sacred Ganges River. According to legend, Kashi was founded by Lord Shiva himself, and its name means “the city of light.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The city’s history stretches back over 3,000 years, with references in ancient texts like the Rigveda. It has been a center of learning, philosophy, music, and art for centuries. The famous Kashi Vishwanath Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is a major pilgrimage site, rebuilt several times after destruction by various rulers.
        </p>
        <h2>Culture & Spiritual Life</h2>
        <p>
          Varanasi is a vibrant tapestry of rituals, festivals, and traditions. The ghats (riverfront steps) bustle with life—pilgrims bathe in the Ganges, priests perform the mesmerizing Ganga Aarti, and sadhus meditate at dawn. The city is renowned for its classical music, silk weaving, and delicious street food.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sarnath, just outside Varanasi, is where Buddha gave his first sermon, making the region sacred for Buddhists as well. The city’s spiritual energy draws seekers from around the world.
        </p>
        <h2>Interesting Stories</h2>
        <p>
          Every corner of Kashi has a story. It is said that dying in Kashi grants moksha (liberation from the cycle of rebirth). The Manikarnika Ghat is famous for its eternal funeral pyres, while the Dashashwamedh Ghat hosts the spectacular evening Aarti. Mark Twain once wrote, “Banaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you seek peace, adventure, or a glimpse into India’s soul, Kashi offers an unforgettable experience.
